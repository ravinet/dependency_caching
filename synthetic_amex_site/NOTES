These directories are synthetic pages which have the same structure as
"https://www.americanexpress.com":
"amex" is the unmodified synthetic site with the exact same structure as the
real american express site, while "amex_move_chains" is a version of the site
where the two deepest chains are moved to the beginning of the top level html
file.

The two pdfs are the dependency graphs (only considering initiators) and they
show how these deep chains are moved between the two cases. The two text files
(amex_mappings.txt and amex_move_chains_mappings.txt) map nodes in the graph to
file names.

These two folders should work out of the box (may have to make certain files
executable). Simply start an apache server (or any other http server) with
access to this folder (synthetic_amex_site). Then, in the browser, navigate to
either "http://hostname/synthetic_amex_site/amex." or
"http://hostname/synthetic_amex_site/amex_move_chains/". "hostname" can be your
ip address or your machine's hostname.
