Cycle-breaking Algorithm:
-Get a list of all cycles in the graph
-Find the last link in each cycle, where "last" is the link visited last from the root node
-Remove the last link that is lowest in the .dot file (dot file has original web deps on top and js deps on bottom)
-Keep removing links until no cycle remains
